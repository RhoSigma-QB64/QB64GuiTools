'Function to write the array(s) defined in the respective .h file back
'to disk. Make sure the path in the DECLARE LIBRARY statement does match
'the actual .h file location. Call this FUNCTION once, before you will
'access the represented file for the first time. After the call always
'use the returned realFile$ ONLY to access the written file, don't add
'any path or extension, as realFile$ is already a full qualified absolute
'path and filename, which is made by expanding your maybe given relative
'path and an maybe altered filename in order to avoid the overwriting of
'an existing file of the same name in the given location. By this means
'you'll always have easy access to the file, no matter how your current
'working folder changes during runtime. If requested, the written file
'can automatically be deleted for you when your program will end, so you
'don't need to worry about the cleanup yourself. This cleanup feature is
'implemented on the C/C++ level by using a "atexit()" function.
'---------------------------------------------------------------------
'SYNTAX: realFile$ = WriteExitImgArray$ (wantFile$, autoDel%)
'
'INPUTS: wantFile$ --> The filename you would like to write the array(s)
'                      to, can contain a full or relative path.
'        autoDel%  --> Shows whether you want the auto cleanup at the
'                      program end or not (-1 = del file, 0 = don't del).
'
'RESULT: realFile$ --> On success the full qualified path and filename
'                      finally used after applied checks, use ONLY this
'                      returned name to access the file, don't add any
'                      path or extension anymore.
'                   -> On failure (write/access) this will be an empty
'                      string, so you should check for it before trying
'                      to access the file.
