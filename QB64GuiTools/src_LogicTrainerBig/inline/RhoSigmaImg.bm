'--- Important ---
'-----------------
' If you need to move around this .bm file and its respective .h file
' to fit in your project, then make sure the path in the DECLARE LIBRARY
' statement below does match the actual .h file location. It's best to
' specify a relative path assuming your QB64 installation folder as root.
'---------------------------------------------------------------------

'------------------------------
'--- WriteRhoSigmaImgArray$ ---
'------------------------------
' This function will write the array(s) you've created with MakeCARR.bas
' back to disk and so it rebuilds the original file.
'
' After the writeback call, only use the returned realFile$ to access the
' written file. It's the full qualified absolute path and filename, which
' is made by expanding your maybe given relative path and an maybe altered
' filename (number added) in order to avoid the overwriting of an already
' existing file with the same name in the given location. By this means
' you'll always have safe access to the file, no matter how your current
' working folder changes during runtime.
'
' If you wish, the written file can automatically be deleted for you when
' your program will end, so you don't need to do the cleanup yourself.
'----------
' SYNTAX:
'   realFile$ = WriteRhoSigmaImgArray$ (wantFile$, autoDel%)
'----------
' INPUTS:
'   --- wantFile$ ---
'    The filename you would like to write the array(s) to, can contain
'    a full or relative path.
'   --- autoDel% ---
'    Shows whether you want the auto cleanup (see description above) at
'    the program end or not (-1 = delete file, 0 = don't delete file).
'----------
' RESULT:
'   --- realFile$ ---
'    - On success this is the full qualified path and filename finally
'      used after all applied checks, use only this returned filename
'      to access the written file.
'    - On failure (write/access) this will be an empty string, so you
'      should check for this before trying to access/open the file.
