- The GuiTools Framework is Windows only, as some Win API calls are used
  for mutual exclusion handling in file GuiAppFrame.h and some other in
  the DECLARE LIBRARY block in GuiAppFrame.bi.

- QB64-GL has issues with INPUT/LINE INPUT/INKEY$/INPUT$/_KEYHIT
  -> using non-US keyboards and/or system input settings, the mentioned
     input functions do return wrong characters or ASCII values for some
     keys or key combinations, or even no input at all
  -> mostly international characters are affected and/or characters which
     require the use of the "AltGr" key available on some keyboards
  -> there's an automatically switched and pretty well workaround used for
     western european languages and respective keyboards for INKEY$ only,
     called InkeyHit$ (see dev_framework\classes\GuiClasses.bm)

- QB64-GL has issues with $SCREENHIDE/_SCREENMOVE
  -> most of it are fixed now, but to avoid race conditions I've added
     a couple of _DELAYs between the screen calls in SUB SetupScreen()
  However, depending on the performance of your computer these may not
  always be sufficient to make it work, sometimes the program window will
  not open at all and the program hangs.
  - As for this reason, the use of the "Processes" tab of the Windows
    TaskManager may be required to kill the program. You should also check
    for multiple instances of the program, as GuiTools its MessageBoxes
    and FileSelect dialogs are in fact just copies of the main program
  - slightly raising the mentioned _DELAY times might solve this issue

- QB64-GL seems to be slow with multiple forms/windows operations
  -> I especially noticed this on some older (Win7 based) Laptops and
     some low cost (inferior equipment) Desktop computers
  -> might be a OpenGL/Gfx driver issue, if you've several GPUs in your
     system (Intel (U)HD Graphics + some Gfx board), then try to assign
     the compiled program to use the Gfx board if possible, as Intel Gfx
     seems to be very slow with any OpenGL based programs, hence also
     such made with QB64-GL
  -> make sure your Gfx drivers are all up to date
