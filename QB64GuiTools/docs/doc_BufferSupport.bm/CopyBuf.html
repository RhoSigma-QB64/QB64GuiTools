<h2>CopyBuf <em>(sub)</em></h2>
<p>This subroutine will copy the entire contents of the given source buffer to
the destination buffer. The destination buffer does not need to be initialized
yet, as this call includes the required init procedure. However, it will not
hurt, if the destination buffer is already initialized or even used and filled
with data. But note, that in this case all previous content of the destination
buffer is discarded and replaced by the copied data.</p>
<p>The copy will also include all markers and find data, as well as the current
buffer position and the active line endings logic of the source buffer. Hence,
you get an exact clone of the source buffer.</p>

<h4>buf$() <em>(STRING array)</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>This is the array of any existing and initialized buffer, which you want
to copy (source buffer). The buffer may still be empty, which would create
an empty copy then.</li>
</ul>
<h4>destBuf$() <em>(STRING array)</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>This must be a 1-dimensional REDIMed (dynamic) <em>STRING</em> array of at least
one element, it will be initialized and filled by this routine to become an
clone of the given source buffer. In alternative it can also be the array
of any existing buffer (destination buffer).</li>
