<h2>Informations &amp; Critical Conditions</h2>
<p>The Simplebuffer System identifies its distinct buffers by using unique
handles. You already know this from images, sounds and fonts. The handles
are returned by all functions which create a new buffer, but as failure
is possible at any time, make sure to check the returned values. Valid
handles are in general positive (ie. &gt;= 0), while errors are negative.</p>
<p>You must pass handles to most buffer functions to designate the desired
buffer for operation. Be aware here, that also positive handle values may
be invalid, if they point to an previously disposed buffer. Passing invalid
handles is considered critical and the buffer system will break the program
execution with an &quot;Invalid handle&quot; error (#258). You cannot continue the
program from this point, as an invalid handle indicates a generic bug in
your program flow logic, which must be solved through bug fixing.</p>
<p>The Simplebuffer System can issue a maximum of 32765 handles, so that
would also be the amount of buffers, which can be active at the same time.
Disposing unused buffers will save memory and make its handles available
for reuse.</p>
<p>Each single buffer can hold a maximum data size of 1GiB. If this size is
exceeded during operation, then the buffer system will break the program
execution with an &quot;Out of memory&quot; error (#7). However, you may continue
the program from here, but note that the load, insert or write operation
responsible for the error was not finished then. Hence the buffer does not
have the expected contents when continuing.</p>
<h2>Caught &amp; Uncaught Errors</h2>
<p>Beside the two critical conditions mentioned above there may be other,
less severe errors. At best the affected functions will simply do nothing
in such cases, but return common error codes. You may check and use these
values to control the further program flow. The error codes shown below
are defined as CONSTs in the <strong>simplebuffer.bi</strong> file.</p>
<p>Note also, that any buffer functions working with files, will not catch the
possible filesystem errors. Only the errors related to the buffer system
itself will be caught and returned by the various buffer functions. Hence,
make sure the files and folders you work with do exist to avoid those
filesystem errors.</p>

<p><strong><em>WARNINGS &amp; ERRORS:</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4>SBE_NoMoreBuffers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Is returned by the functions <a href="CreateBuf.html">CreateBuf()</a>, <a href="FileToBuf.html">FileToBuf()</a> and <a href="CloneBuf.html">CloneBuf()</a>,
it means there are no more buffers available (max. 32765). You should always
dispose no longer needed buffers to make its handles available for reuse
(see <a href="DisposeBuf.html">DisposeBuf()</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h4>SBE_NoMoreIDs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Is returned by <a href="SetBufMark.html">SetBufMark()</a> and <a href="SetBufFind.html">SetBufFind()</a>, it means there are no more
bookmark or find IDs available (max. 100). You should always remove no
longer needed bookmarks and search criteria to make its IDs available for
reuse (see <a href="RemoveBufMark.html">RemoveBufMark()</a> and <a href="RemoveBufFind.html">RemoveBufFind()</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h4>SBE_EmptyFind</h4>
<ul>
<li>This error is returned by <a href="SetBufFind.html">SetBufFind()</a> only. It happens when you pass an
empty search criteria string to the function. Looking for &quot;nothing&quot; makes
not much sense, obviously.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SBE_UnknownMode</h4>
<ul>
<li>Is returned by function <a href="SeekBuf.html">SeekBuf()</a> only, it means the given mode argument
was not recognized by the function. This may be because of an typo in the mode
name, look up the correct spelling in file <strong>simplebuffer.bi</strong>, if in doubt.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SBE_OutOfBounds</h4>
<ul>
<li>This error may be returned by several functions, it means a given or by a
displacement calculated position is out of the valid buffer data range, which
is usually 1 to <a href="GetBufLen.html">GetBufLen()</a> + 1.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SBE_BadIDNumber</h4>
<ul>
<li>Is mainly returned by the various marker and find functions, but also by
<a href="SeekBuf.html">SeekBuf()</a>, if you make a bookmark seek. It means, that the given bookmark
or find ID was out of the valid range 1 to 100. This may indicate the use
of a wrong or misspelled variable for the ID number, as <a href="SetBufMark.html">SetBufMark()</a> and
<a href="SetBufFind.html">SetBufFind()</a> usually return valid IDs on successful calls.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SBE_UnusedID</h4>
<ul>
<li>Also returned by the various marker and find functions, it means you tried
to get, goto or seek to an unset bookmark, or search for yet undefined criteria.
This can be seen as warning only, as the respective functions will simply
ignore those calls. However, this may also indicate the use of a wrong or
misspelled variable for the ID number.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SBE_ClearedID</h4>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the above, but only returned by the marker related functions and
<a href="SeekBuf.html">SeekBuf()</a>. It means the accessed bookmark became invalid, because the data at
the marked position were deleted. It's also just a warning, you may remove
the bookmark to make its ID available for reuse.</li>
</ul>
