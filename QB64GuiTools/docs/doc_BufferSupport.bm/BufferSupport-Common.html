</blockquote>

<h4>SBE_UnknownMode</h4>
<ul>
<li>Is returned by function <a href="SeekBuf.html">SeekBuf()</a> only, it means the given mode argument
was not recognized by the function. This may be because of an typo in the mode
name, look up the correct spelling in file <strong>BufferSupport.bi</strong>, if in doubt.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SBE_OutOfBounds</h4>
<ul>
<li>This error may be returned by several functions, it means a given or by a
displacement calculated position is out of the valid buffer data range, which
is usually 1 to <a href="GetBufLen.html">GetBufLen()</a> + 1.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SBE_BadIDNumber</h4>
<ul>
<li>Is mainly returned by the various marker and find functions, but also by
<a href="SeekBuf.html">SeekBuf()</a>, if you make a marker seek. It means, that the given marker
or find ID was out of the valid range 1 to 100.</li>
<li>If returned by <a href="FreeBufMarkID.html">FreeBufMarkID()</a> or <a href="FreeBufFindID.html">FreeBufFindID()</a>, then there are no more
unused IDs available. You should always remove no longer needed markers and
find data to make its IDs available for reuse (see <a href="RemoveBufMark.html">RemoveBufMark()</a> and
<a href="RemoveBufFind.html">RemoveBufFind()</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h4>SBE_UnusedID</h4>
<ul>
<li>Also returned by the various marker and find functions, it means you tried
to get, goto, seek or remove an unused marker, find or remove unused find data.
However, this can be seen as warning for you only, as the respective functions
will simply ignore those calls.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SBE_ClearedID</h4>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the above, but only returned by the marker related functions and
<a href="SeekBuf.html">SeekBuf()</a>. It means the accessed marker is invalid, because the data at the
marked position were deleted. It's also more or less just a warning. You may
reassign the respective marker ID to a new position directly or remove the
marker to make its ID available for later reuse.</li>
</ul>
