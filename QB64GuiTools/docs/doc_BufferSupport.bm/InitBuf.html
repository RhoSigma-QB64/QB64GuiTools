<h2>InitBuf <em>(sub)</em></h2>
<p>The String buffers are regular string arrays. However, before you can use an
array as string buffer, the array needs to have a certain amount of elements
and some of the elements have to be initialized with certain values. So the
easiest way to init a new buffer, is to create a new dynamic (REDIM) string
array of at least one element and then immediately call this subroutine given
the created array as argument. After that is done, the buffer is ready for use.</p>
<p>This routine can also be used to quickly clear, reset and reinitialize any
existing buffer. Ie. it will discard the regular data stored in the buffer,
also any set markers and find data are cleared. The current buffer position
is set to the first byte and the buffer will use the OS native line endings.</p>

<ul>
<li>This must be a 1-dimensional REDIMed (dynamic) <em>STRING</em> array of at least
one element, it will be adjusted by this routine to become a usable buffer.</li>
