<h2>DeleteBufLine <em>(sub)</em></h2>
<p>This subroutine will delete the remaining part of the current line, ie. it
will erase data from the specified buffer starting at the current buffer
position (which may be anywhere in the line) and continuing until it finds
the next line break (according to the active line endings mode of the buffer)
or until the buffer end, if no more line breaks exist. The erase does include
the found line break (if any).</p>
<p>The call will also recalculate all bookmarks to maintain its respective
positions. Any bookmarks formerly set on the deleted data will be invalidated.
The current buffer position remains unchanged after the call, as the following
data (if any) will move up to fill the gap (ie. the next line's start will
be on that position then). Hence, sequential deleting is easily possible with
subsequent calls.</p>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the current buffer position, this routine will not necessarily
erase the entire line as it is present in the buffer.</li>
<li>To make sure you erase a line entirely, you may want to move the current
buffer position to the start of the line before calling this subroutine, if
this is not guaranteed automatically (eg. by deleting lines sequentially).</li>
<li>You may move the current buffer position to the line start using the
function <a href="SeekBuf.html">SeekBuf()</a> with an displacement of zero (0) and mode SBM_LineStart.</li>
</ul>
