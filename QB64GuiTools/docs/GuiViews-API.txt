GuiViews - the multiple forms/windows API of GuiTools
=====================================================

Find the following SUBs and FUNCTIONs and its respective descriptions in
file dev_framework\classes\GuiClasses.bm.

See also the example in folder src_MultiWinDemo to learn how to use these
SUBs and FUNCTIONs to create multiple forms.

---------------------------------
--- PUBLIC (use where needed) ---
---------------------------------

FUNCTION CreateGuiView& (viewTitle$, viewWidth%, viewHeight%)
- create a new GuiView with given characteristics
- save the result in a variable for later use in ViewTag$() and others

SUB DeleteGuiView (vix&)
- close the given GuiView (if open), delete all objects designated to it
  and finally free all resources allocated by CreateGuiView()
- the GuiView index becomes invalid after this call

SUB OpenGuiView (winIcon$, winTitle$, vix&)
- open the given GuiView's window with optional icon and title
- use in your event handlers as required
- does not hurt if the respective window is already open

SUB CloseGuiView (vix&)
- close the given GuiView's window programmatically
- use in your event handlers as required
- does not hurt if the respective window is not open

FUNCTION GuiViewIsOpen% (vix&)
- given the result from CreateGuiView(), check if the respective GuiView's
  window is currently open or not
- use it to check whether the user did close a particular GuiView window

FUNCTION ViewTag$ (vix&)
- given the result from CreateGuiView(), create the GUIVIEW tag given to
  object INIT calls to designate the object to the desired GuiView

-------------------------------------
--- GUIREFRESH event handler only ---
-------------------------------------

SUB SourceDestGuiView (vix&)
- given the result from CreateGuiView(), it will set _SOURCE and _DEST
  to the respective GuiView's image
- mostly internal, you only need it to activate the desired GuiView, if
  you wanna render own stuff in the GUIREFRESH event handler
- if you need to change _SOURCE and _DEST yourself for any (temporary)
  image operations, then make sure to save and later restore the old values

----------------
--- INTERNAL ---
----------------

SUB UpdateGuiViews
- mostly internal, update all GuiView windows, similar to _DISPLAY
- whenever a _DISPLAY is done, a UpdateGuiViews() should be done too
