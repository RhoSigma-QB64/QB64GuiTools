A quick introduction into the program structure
===============================================

The GuiTools Framework ??
In general a very big library of many useful functions, which you will
probably never need to its fullest extent, combined with its own special
init and exit/cleanup procedures, designed to make sure that all programs
made with the framework can co-exist and safely running at the same time
without interferrences, but can nevertheless profit from shared resources.

Ie: You get a ready to use program template/skeleton at hand, in which
    you just add your GUI design and the handling code for your objects
    in its contextual designated places, while leaving everything else
    in the program just as it is.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wanna try to do your own application, then the folder src_GuiApp
is your starting point. This is a ready to use program skeleton, which
you shouldn't mess up. Ie. your first task should be to make a copy of
that folder with its entire content and rename that copy as you like,
eg. src_MyApp. Then also reaname the file GuiApp.bas inside to MyApp.bas.

First thing I want to bring to your attention is the fact, that everything
inside GuiApp.bas (respectively MyApp.bas) are just GOSUB style subroutines,
as well as regular SUBs and FUNCTIONs. The GOSUB subroutines are called from
the appropriate places in the GuiTools Framework init procedure, which is
mostly contained in and $INCLUDEd from the file dev_framework\GuiAppFrame.bi
and therfore these subroutines are always running in the context of the main
module and need to be ended with a simple RETURN instruction. Ie. there
should be no END or SYSTEM in your own code.

GuiApp/MyApp.bas has several sections, which you can easily find by searching
for its headings or program labels, or simply by scrolling from top to bottom
following the next paragraphs. This also gives you the chance to read the
comments along the code.

1. The heading "My Init/Exit Handlers" with the labels
    - UserInitHandler:
    - UserExitHandler:
   For simple programs you may probably leave this section alone. You need
   it, if you wanna embed MakeDATA/MakeCARR based files or if you need to
   do your own special init/exit stuff.
   The Init Handler is called before entering your main program and the
   Exit Handler is called after your main program did RETURN.

2. The heading "My Error Handler" with the label
    - UserErrorHandler:
   This is the regular error handler of your program. In its current form
   it just shows a MessageBox about the error and will then nicely branch
   back into the GuiTools Framework exit/cleanup procedure, which of course
   also includes calling the UserExitHandler: label. You may add your stuff
   in this error handler to deal with specific errors.

Right after the error handler you find the label
 - UserMain:
As you may guess, this is your main program. It has mainly two sub-sections:

3. The heading "My GUI Setup"
   Here is the place to initialize your GUI objects like buttons, frames,
   sliders and so on. Right in front of this heading you have an area with
   the comment "Early required Globals", which you should use in conjunction
   with the GUI setup as needed.

4. The heading "My Main Loop"
   This is the main loop of the application. You usually don't need to
   change anything here. The main loop contains the operational event
   handler for your entire GUI, ie. it calls the input handler and then
   passes the received event messages through all event handler blocks,
   which I've outsourced into its own files (see "handlers" sub-folder)
   for better overview and contextual separation. Note that all these
   handlers are still running in the context of the main module, hence
   you don't need to SHARE any of your object handles created in the
   "My GUI Setup" section to use it in the handlers. You should have a
   look into this handler files to learn about the possible events. These
   files are the places where you add your magic code into the application
   to handle clicks, keypresses, mouse events etc., for the beginning you
   should at least be familiar with GUIREFRESH, USERBREAK, KEYPRESS and
   GADGETUP events. To exit the main loop and cleanly end your program
   you just need to set the runtime variable "done%" to any non-zero value
   (best -1 for "true") within any of the event handlers.

After the main loop you find two more sections:

5. The heading "My GOSUB routines" and
6. The heading "My SUBs/FUNCs"
   Here is the place for your own routines, SUBs and FUNCTIONs as needed.
   As part of the latter section, you also have
7. The heading "My Screen Setup/Cleanup" with the standard SUBs
    - SetupScreen
    - CloseScreen
   These SUBs are used in your main program (UserMain:) to setup the
   program window in the beginning and close it before the RETURN.
