<h2>SearchFile$ <em>(function)</em></h2>
<p>This function will recursively search the given drive or folder for the
specified file, ie. it will start in the given place and walk through that
place and all its subfolders to locate the file. If the file was found, then
it is returned inclusive its full qualified absolute path.</p>

<p><strong><em>INPUTS:</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h4>startDir$ <em>(STRING)</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>This is the place where to start the search, it can be any valid drive
or folder specification. If this is empty, then the search starts in the
current working folder.</li>
<li>Note that searching a whole drive or a folder with many files may take very
long and will freeze your program for that time. For best performance there
should be not more than appox. 1000 files in that place (counted recursively).</li>
</ul>
<h4>mustHave$ <em>(STRING)</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>This may be either empty or any (even partial) path specification, which
must appear in the final path. It's useful to target the right file, if you
have several files of the same name scattered over different subfolders.</li>
</ul>
<h4>file$ <em>(STRING)</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>The name of the file to search, any given path is ignored.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>RESULT:</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h4>filespec$ <em>(STRING)</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>On success this is the full specification of the found file, ie. inclusive
its full qualified path (starting with drive letter).</li>
<li>
If the result is empty, then either of the following happened:
<ul>
<li>The given startDir$ was invalid or not found.</li>
<li>The file was not found in that place inclusive its subfolders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
