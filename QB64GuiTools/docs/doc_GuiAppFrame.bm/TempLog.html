<h2>TempLog <em>(sub)</em></h2>
<p>Add an entry to the global logging system for temporary files.
All registered files will be deleted automatically during the program's
cleanup procedure (ie. at regular program end, unexpected error
abort or forced exit by the user (window's <em>&quot;X&quot;</em> button, <em>&lt;Alt-F4&gt;</em> etc.)).</p>

<p><strong><em>INPUTS:</em></strong></p>

</blockquote>
<h4>file$ <em>(STRING)</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>The name of the temporary file you did create, it's length is limited
to 30 chars. Any included path will be ignored, as temporary files should
naturally go into the system's TEMP path. Simply use the globally SHARED
variable appTempDir$ + &quot;filename&quot; when working with temporary files.</li>
</ul>
<h4>comm$ <em>(STRING)</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>This can be an optional comment for that file (eg. contents etc.)
or simply leave it empty. The length is limited to 80 chars.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>NOTES:</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Although the files are deleted automatically, you should still KILL
your temporary files, if not longer needed. Rather see this system as a
safety net for correct cleanup in error situations or if the user hits the
window's <em>&quot;X&quot;</em> button in a sudden unexpected time. The system is also smart
enough to identify remaining temporary files of previously crashed GuiTools
based programs. Those remains will be deleted as soon as a new GuiTools
session is started, ie. when the first GuiTools based program is started
after all running GuiTools programs were closed previously.</li>
</ul>
