<h2>UserErrHandler <em>(sub)</em></h2>
<p>Switch the error handling to the User error handler. Different from the
Internal error handler, the globally SHARED variable appLastErr% is not
cleared by this routine, instead it will keep the number of the last error
(which was maybe set by the Internal error handler), so you can still check
for an error from the Internal handler after you've switched back to the
User handler. This behavior allows for shorter periods with the Internal
handler active. The User handler itself will (again) store the number of
any occurred error to the variable appLastErr% for later check and will then
do some actions for the respective error. Finally it will RESUME to any
appropriate position, which may either continue the program or do a regular
cleanup and then abort the program, depending on the error. You may also add
your own magic into the User error handler as needed.</p>
