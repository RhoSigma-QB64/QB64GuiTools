INetRadio - The Internet Radio Player
-------------------------------------
This program was made possible due to the excellent capabilities of the QB64-PE
language and by utilising the GuiTools Framework's multi-window functionality.

Windows can be opened/closed independently. When closing the main program all
other still open windows will automatically cloese too. You may arrange the
windows and they will remember its positions.

INetRadio is mostly self-explaining, so it should be easy to explore all its
features even without a comprehensive documentation. Most controls have tooltips
attached to it, which pop up after a second when resting the mouse over it.

INetRadio makes use of the huge Pan Unicode font arialuni.ttf, so it can even
display Stations/Titles of many countries which doesn't use latin script.

Compiling and EXE
-----------------
You should compile INetRadio either directly into its source folder or move
the compiled EXE there afterwards, so it can find its INR-Assets folder.
Or expressed different, when you move the EXE to your desired place, then also
make sure to place a copy of the INR-Assets folder in the same location.

How can I add my favorite Radio Station?
----------------------------------------
1. The Radio Station must provide the real audio stream address for use in
   external players on their website. This can either be as text you can copy
   or as link/button you can click to download a single entry *.m3u, *.m3u8 or
   *.pls file containing the required stream address.
   What i mean is something like the "Play in your MP3 Player" button on
   http://www.absolutechillout.com/ or the various links and addresses on
   https://www.radioswissjazz.ch/de/empfang/internet.
   If the Station doesn't offer such links but rather want you to subscribe or
   download and use their own App, then you can assume they most probably won't
   even allow external players accessing their streams anyways.
   Note also that Stations may restrict streaming in/for/to certain countries,
   a quick test using the embedded player on their website will show you.
2. Clicking the stream address link/button will usually start downloading a
   single entry *.m3u, *.m3u8 or *.pls file. If the Station only offers a
   stream address to copy, but no download, then simply copy the address and
   paste it into a new blank text file and save that as StationName.m3u. If
   the Station offers multiple stream encodings, then make sure to choose a
   format supported by QB64-PE, that is Mp3, Ogg, Wav or Aiff/Aifc.
3. You can now import the just downloaded (or saved) file into INetRadio in
   the "Stations Manager" window.
4. If required, you may edit the Radio Station's name after importing.

Notes
-----
- plain *.m3u(8) and *.pls files do not contain the Stations name, instead the
  filename is inserted in the Stations list and you may edit it afterwards
- files using the extended *.m3u(8) format contain the correct Station name
