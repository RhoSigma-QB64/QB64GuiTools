For the contents of the "images" folder various rules apply, however
these rules still allow free use & copying, if followed correctly.

The country flags were taken from the 3DFlags_310.zip archive available
from https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/style/3d_countrystate_flags,
which is under the GNU General Public License version 2 (see GPL-2.0.txt).

The misc icons are available for download here:
Size 32px => https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/32x32-free-design-icons
Size 16px => https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/6x16-free-application-icons
   the link works, typo (missing 1) is correct  ^^
you are free to copy, share, modify and use the icons, even commercially,
as long as you include a link to the authors website (http://www.aha-soft.com/),
what is done hereby. However, you're not allowed to sell the icons itself.

The patterns and wallpaper images were collected from various free
available sources such as image/clipart collections shipped via cover
CDs/DVDs of computer print magazines and Google picture search.
 For both, Google & CDs/DVDs I've double checked to choose only those
images, which were explicitly marked as "free for non-commercial re-use",
so there should no copyright issues arise, as long as you only use these
images in private/free productions.

An exception is the image "TheKnot.jpg" which is copyright by the
german artist "Roland Heyder" (yes he has the same name as me, but it's
not me). However, Mr. Heyder explicitly stated on his website, that he
is fine with the non-commercial re-use of his pictures, as long as nobody
claims to be the author or copyright holder of the pictures. Also his
website (http://www.heyland7.de/) must be explicitly mentioned as the
picture's source, what is done hereby.
